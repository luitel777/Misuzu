This is still in early stages and my main purpose for writing this is to learn go properly instead 
of wasting time like I did on 2022.

## Misuzu
- A place to store my thoughts with references
- Consider this as my self host website where I can update my thoughts from book I'm reading or whenver I'm feeling philoshopical

## Running Misuzu
- docker compose up (for postgresql)
- go mod tidy
- go run cmd/Misuzu/*

## TODO
- A good looking frontend [Bulma css]
- Implement title and references OR implement parser for content to find it
- Save/Retrive content <-> Database [Partly done]
- Configs for the web
- I know my conventions are f*ked up. I have yet to learn how to make proper web apps.
- Add tests
- Rest API integration
- Much more...
